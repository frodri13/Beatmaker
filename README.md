# Beatmaker

This project consists of a sound or Beatmaker app that allows the user to select a kick, snare or hihat sound at specific beats. The app will run in a continuous loop until the user wants to stop it.

The tempo can be changed between 20 and 300 beats per min.

## How to view?

I am currently hosting it here: `https://sad-khorana-46b20f.netlify.app/`

## Additional functionalities to be implemented

1. More sounds and options to be added.

2. Day/night mode.

3. Further testing.
